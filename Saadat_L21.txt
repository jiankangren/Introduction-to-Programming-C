/*
Once upon a time there was a student. Her name was Saadat and she was 17 years old. It was 8 pm and she was doing 
lesson 21. Suddenly she felt herself very hungry and bought a GIANT pizza, its cost was 5000 tenge. So it was too 
big. And when I say big I mean REALLY BIG. So she divided pizza to 45 pieces and gave them to each member of Choir.
And they lived long lives happily together.
THE END.
